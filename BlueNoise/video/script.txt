Audio: In this paper, we present a technique to generate Poisson disk samples in parallel on a GPU.

Audio: Our algorithm generates samples in a multi-resolution fashion. Here we show our GPU program generating a set of 2D Poisson disk samples. Each pixel encodes a sample location by its color, with black pixels indicating absence of any sample.

And here is the final set of samples. Due to parallel computation, our algorithm runs very fast and can generate up to 3.6 million samples per second on a commodity GPU.

In addition, the result sample set has excellent blue noise spectrum, as shown here.

Audio: our algorithm can also generate Poisson disk samples in higher dimensions. Here, we show a case of 3D samples.

Video: show adaptive sampling results power spectrum
Audio: our algorithm can also be applied for adaptive sampling as shown here.
