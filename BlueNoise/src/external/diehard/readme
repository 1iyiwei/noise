This directory contains C files for inclusion in

Marsaglia's Diehard Battery of Tests of Randomness.

The command
               make
will compile and incorporate all the files into an executable file: diehard.
(and also produce *.o (object) files for each *.c file).

Then the command
           diehard
will prompt for the name of the file to be tested.

That file must be a form="unformatted",access="direct" binary
file of from 10 to 12 million bytes.  The tests use various substrings
of bits from the specified file, or form floats from 32-bit strings
for tests that call for uniform [0,1) random variables.
Because of the way that Fortran and C do things, the
test results here are likely to be different from those produced by
the original Fortran version of Diehard, but all tests are based on
the assumption that the input file is a string of random 0's and 1's.
The substrings may be formed in different ways in the C or Fortran
implementations.

The 'make' command will invoke the gcc (gnu C) compiler, so your
system must have that compiler to use this C version of DIEHARD.
It was translated from the original Fortran files by Dagang Wang,
as the f2c conversions led to problems on some systems.

If you have problems, or suggestions, please let me know.
